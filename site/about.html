       	  <div id="left_text">
       	    <p>Revive Physical Therapy and Wellness Center is a boutique physical therapy clinic specializing in holistic, hands on healing. Acknowledging the balance of mind, body and spirit, our treatments combine Eastern and Western philosophies. Treatment focuses on the body as a whole, rather than just an injured body part.  Our dedication to preserving and enhancing lifestyles includes incorporating the entire body in pain-free mobility, proper postural alignment, and balance in movement.

       	    <p>Directed by Diane Shiao, PT, MSPT, DPT, Doctor of Physical Therapy, Revive PT offers a complete wellness environment to promote healing and rejuvenation of the body.            </p>
       	    <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h3>Diane Shiao PT, MSPT, DPT            </h3>
            <p>Diane received her Bachelor’s of Science and Master's Degrees from a top-rated Physical Therapy program at Boston University's Sargent College. After several years of work experience in varied therapy settings, she returned to school and graduated with a Doctorate degree from New York’s Dominican College of Blauvelt. As an active member of the American Physical Therapy Association, Diane expands her knowledge base by frequently attending seminars approved by her professional organization.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Besides having an extensive academic knowledge in the field, Diane is well trained by her father, a Master Practitioner, in the science & art of Chinese Acupressure. Following her father’s footsteps, Diane has been touted to have “magical hands” as a “miracle worker”. Under the teaching of Master Barbosa, Diane is also a Reiki III Practitioner. With both practices dealing with Qi or life’s force energy, Diane treats not only with anatomical knowledge but also with energy flow in mind and body. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Diane enjoys treating clients of all ages from the adolescent to the elderly. She has a knack for motivating seniors in balance and coordination training but can also challenge the highest-level of athletes. With a background in competitive dancing (ballet, tap, lyrical, & jazz), Diane easily learned Yoga and Pilates for rehabilitation and often incorporates dance therapy into her practice. With such a repertoire of skills, every client finds Diane adaptable in personalizing an effective treatment program for them.</p><br />
